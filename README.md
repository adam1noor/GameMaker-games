# GameMaker-games
Games that I created during my time in Secondary School can be found here.

They were created using GameMaker 7 and are quite outdated in design as my programming skills have vastly improved since. For a more recent take on what my programming skills look like check out my Transputer Interpreter here: https://github.com/adam1noor/transputer-simulator

Platform Engine 3.5 has been modified by my brother since I created and his additions include the levers found in certain levels
